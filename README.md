This is wyattscarpenter's live web demo that uses baygeldin's fullwidth module.

To see the demo, please visit https://wyattscarpenter.github.io/fullwidth/. You can also look at my source code (it's mostly just the original code, plus an index.html) at https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/fullwidth/

To see the original module, please visit https://github.com/baygeldin/fullwidth. You can also use a demo of the original module that was also written by baygeldin https://baygeldin.name/fullwidth-element/components/fullwidth-element/

Special thanks to martinheidegger, who in baygeldin's module implemented the most important of all fullwidth characters: the fullwidth space. Without him, this demo would be just as disappointing as all the other ones I can find online.
